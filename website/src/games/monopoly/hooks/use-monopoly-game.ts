/**
 * Drives a game against the computer from React.
 *
 * @module
 * @remarks
 * The same shape as the other games of the collection: the engine is the
 * referee, and this only decides *when* the computer players move, keeping the
 * session, the play time and the statistics in order.
 *
 * A Monopoly turn is **a dozen moves** - roll, buy, build, build, offer, end -
 * so the effect fires once per move rather than once per turn. That is what
 * lets a player watch what an opponent did instead of finding the board
 * rearranged.
 *
 * The seat the effect waits for is {@link seatOnTurn}, not `active`, and in this
 * game those come apart constantly: an auction is answered by whoever has to
 * bid, a trade by whoever it was put to, and a debt by whoever owes it. None of
 * those need be the player whose turn it is.
