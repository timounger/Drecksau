/**
 * Drives a game against the computer from React.

 * @remarks
 * The effect asks the engine **who the table is waiting for** rather than whose
 * turn it is, and in this game those come apart constantly: an action card is
 * pointed by whoever drew it, the three cards of a Dreimal are turned over by
 * their victim, and the next round is dealt by the next dealer. None of those
 * need be the player on turn.
