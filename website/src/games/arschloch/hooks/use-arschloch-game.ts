/**
 * Drives a game against the computer from React.

 * @module
 * @remarks
 * The same shape as the other games of the collection: the engine is the
 * referee, and this only decides *when* the computer players move, keeping the
 * session, the play time and the statistics in order.
 *
 * The settings are read out of storage at mount rather than through the ref:
 * they arrive through an external store that exists only in the browser, and at
 * the first commit the ref may still hold what the prerender rendered with.
